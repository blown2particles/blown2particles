	<p1> Matt Leavitt is a passionate Multimedia Artist with demonstrated abilities working with 3D Modeling, Motion Graphics & Online video since 2009.  My journey as an artist began at a young age with a mission to create video games and animation.
​		 I spent 5 years studying at Indiana-Purdue University Fort Wayne (IPFW) where I studied Computer Art & Marketing.  During my stay there I also had the honor of being apart of the JASMAR Animation Group.   In 2006, I transferred to Savannah College of Art & Design (SCAD) to complete my BFA in Visual Effects in 2009.
​		 Since graduations I've worked at Indiana's News Center, YouTube projects including Geek & Sundry's Written by a Kid, episode 4, 'Fire City' staring Battlestar Galactica's Aaron Douglas, directed by Jon Simms.
​		 My other endeavors involve online marketing, branding & business development.

	<p1> I currently reside in Fort Wayne, Indiana providing services focused on the local community.  My personal activities are focused on spending time with my loving girlfriend and our beautiful little girl. 
		 Having her growing amazement towards the world filling her already vivid imagination has reignited a creative light that being an adult can wash away.
		 Some of our creative past-times include: Home-made coloring books, sidewalk characters, pancake art & anything else she gets us into.
